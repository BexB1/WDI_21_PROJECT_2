### User Stories 

"As a user, I want to set myself goals to achieve, and view other peoples' goals."

### Approach taken

First, I began with the wireframes. I made these using Balsamiq.

I kept the design simple so that the layout would be simple to customise for mobile devices, and the layout would remain much the same across mobile and desktop devices.

### Bugs

No known bugs.

### Future features

At the end of the project, ThirtyWins remained true to what I intended it to be at the design stage. However, I had to abandon some plans. Therefore, features I intend to add in the future include:

- The ability to add comments to pledges.
- The ability to add other uses as friends.
- A search function for pledges and categories.
- Futher gamification through leveling up by achieving goals, and earning medals and trophies.
- Push notifications and desktop notifications.

### And lastly...


Thank you for checking out ThirtyWins. I hope it helps you achieve your goals!
